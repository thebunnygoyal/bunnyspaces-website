   <div class="qr-code" style="...">
       [QR Code for ₹599 Payment]
   </div>
   ```

   ```html
   <img src="YOUR_QR_CODE_URL_599" alt="Payment QR for 1 Guest" class="qr-code">
   ```

   You can either:
   - Upload QR codes to your repo and use relative URLs
   - Use image hosting service like Imgur
   - Use any CDN

### 2. **Update WhatsApp Number**
In `index.html`, find and update:
```html
<a href="https://wa.me/91XXXXXXXXXX" target="_blank">+91 XXXXXXXXXX</a>
```
Replace `XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual WhatsApp number (without spaces or dashes).

### 3. **Update Community Link** (Optional)
In `script.js`, update the community WhatsApp group link:
```javascript
window.open('https://wa.me/message/YOUR_WHATSAPP_LINK', '_blank');
